    <p>Now, suppose that you are rewarded 100 Euro for completing the survey.
        You can invest part of (or all) your reward in a risky investment.
        <br>
        With the risky investment, in half of the cases you will win and gain 2.5 times the amount you invest,
        in half of the cases you will lose the amount you invest.</p>

    <p>The program will randomly draw an outcome at the end of the survey, "win" or "lose".</p>

    <p>The amount you do not invest is not affected by the outcome of the risky asset.
        Use the slider to see your potential gain and loss with the risky asset
        and decide what percentage of your rewards to invest in it.</p>

    <div class="slidecontainer">
        <input type="range" min="1" max="100" value="50" class="slider" id="myRange" name="risk_choice">
    </div>

    <p>You invest <span id="demo"></span> Euro of 100 Euro in the risky investment.
        <br>
        <b>In half of the cases, you will gain <span id="demo_win"></span>% over your original reward.
        <br>
            In half of the cases, you will lose <span id="demo_loss"></span>% of your original reward.
